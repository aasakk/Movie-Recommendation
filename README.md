  # Movie-Recommendation
Project Overview-
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to suggest movies to users based on their past preferences. This system utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. By analyzing user ratings and movie features, the system predicts what movies a user might enjoy, enhancing their movie-watching experience.

Features-
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on similarities between users. If users A and B have similar taste, movies liked by user B will be recommended to user A.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on similarities between movies. If a user liked movie X, they will be recommended movies similar to X.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies by analyzing movie attributes (genre, director, cast, etc.) and comparing them to the attributes of movies the user has liked in the past.
Hybrid Filtering: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
